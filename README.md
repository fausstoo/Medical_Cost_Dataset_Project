# Project 1: Medical Cost Dataset 
## Overview:
The dataset is about 1,339 medical insurance records. The individual medical costs billed by health insurance are the target variable charges, and the rest of columns contain personal information such as age, gender, family status, and whether the patient smokes among other features.
Although it's a very used dataset for ML linear regression example, this project is enterly focused in a brief demonstration of cleaning techniques using Pandas, feature engineering using Sklearn and Seaborn with Matplotlib for visualizations.
